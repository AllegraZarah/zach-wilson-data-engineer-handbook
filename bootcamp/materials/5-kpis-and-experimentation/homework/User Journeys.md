## User Journeys

### Building & Creating Playlists
- As a user, I am listening to a song I love and thinking, "This would fit perfectly in a vibe I want to create."
- I tap the three-dot menu beside the song, select "Add to Playlist," and create a new playlist.
- I name the playlist something fitting, like "Summer Chill."
- I am adding more songs—some come to mind immediately, while others are inspired by Spotify’s recommendations at the bottom of the playlist.
- I am exploring and picking tracks from these recommendations, enriching the playlist effortlessly.
- I keep revisiting the playlist, shuffling tracks to perfect the flow and adding new songs whenever I discover something that fits.


### Starting a Jam
- As a user, I want to share music with friends, so I start a Jam.
- I pick a playlist, tap the "Start a Jam" button, and send the invite link to my friends.
- My friends and I are now listening to the same track in sync, no matter where we are.
- We take turns queuing up songs, each adding our own flavor to the session.
- We laugh over surprise picks, reminisce about shared favorites, and enjoy the collaborative experience.
- The Jam feels like a virtual hangout, making music more interactive and social.


### Listening to a Podcast and Setting Up a Queue
- As a user, I am scrolling through Spotify’s homepage and discover a podcast that catches my interest.
- I click on the podcast, browse the episodes, and start listening to one that grabs my attention.
- While listening, I remember another podcast I want to check out and search for it.
- I add an episode from the second podcast to my queue, building a lineup of content to enjoy.
- I continue exploring, adding more episodes to my queue as I come across intriguing titles.
- I reorder the queue, prioritizing episodes I am most excited about, ensuring a seamless listening experience.
- Even if I pause, Spotify remembers my place, making it easy to resume right where I left off.
